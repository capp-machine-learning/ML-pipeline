# Machine Learning Pipeline with Delinquency Data

The goal of this assignment is to build a simple, modular, extensible, machine learning pipeline in Python. The pipeline should have functions that can do the following tasks:

1. Read/Load Data

2. Explore Data

3. Pre-Process and Clean Data

4. Generate Features/Predictors

5. Build Machine Learning Classifier

6. Evaluate Classifier

## Getting Started

I used conda as the environment manager.

### Prerequisites

1. Clone the repository.

        $ git clone https://github.com/capp-machine-learning/delinquency-ml-analysis-pipeline.git
        $ cd delinquency-ml-analysis-pipeline

1. A yml file of the environment is available in environment.yml.

        $ conda env create --file=environment.yml
        $ conda activate mlpipe
