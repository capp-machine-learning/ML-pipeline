# ML-pipeline

The goal of this assignment is to build a simple, modular, extensible, machine learning pipeline in Python. The pipeline should have functions that can do the following tasks:

1. Read/Load Data

2. Explore Data

3. Pre-Process and Clean Data

4. Generate Features/Predictors

5. Build Machine Learning Classifier

6. Evaluate Classifier

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
